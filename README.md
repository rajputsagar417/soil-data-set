# soil-data-set
This project is focused on the collection, storage, and processing of soil-related data for research, agricultural planning, and environmental analysis. It aims to provide a structured and scalable approach to gather and manage soil data from different geographical locations.
🎯 Objectives
Collect soil parameters such as pH, moisture, temperature, nitrogen content, etc.

Store data in a structured format (CSV, JSON, or database).

Enable easy access and analysis of the data for researchers and developers.

Support integration with sensors or manual data entry methods.

📂 Features
Modular code for sensor integration or manual input.

Data logging and real-time storage.

Ready-to-use scripts for basic preprocessing and visualization.

Scalable structure for future data types or expansion.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python (for scripting and data handling)

CSV/JSON/SQLite (for data storage)

Optional: Arduino/Raspberry Pi (for real-time sensor data collection)
